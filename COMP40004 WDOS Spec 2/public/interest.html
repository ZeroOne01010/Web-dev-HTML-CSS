            <p id="intro-para">I have been studying cyber security 3 years prior to deciding to study for a degree at
                Staffordshire
                university. During this time I have completed online training courses in software development and
                bootcamps revolving around Information security and ethical hacking </p>

            My love of cyber security came from watching a show called Mr.Robot. I found this show truly fascinating
            about how susceptible we are to cyber-criminals. After watching all the episodes I decided to look at what I
            could find and about how I can get
            more involved in the field. I found government funded courses which covered a range of topics within
            Cyber-sec,
        </p>

        <p>I chose the cyber analyst/ ethical hacker pathway as this was what I was truly interested in. The course took
            12 weeks to complete and I had to use up all
            my holidays for the year in order to complete the course. The learning was quite intensive but fascinating
            at the same time, I really enjoyed the ethical hacking, it was fun to learn and challenging. I also used
            tryHackMe which is a website that allows you to practice
            in a sandbox environment various hacking techniques.
